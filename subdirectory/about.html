                    <h2>About Dish Share</h2>
                    <p>Dish Share was created by a group of four undergraduate students from Stevens Institute of Technology. Our mission is to provide a platform where users can share their favorite recipes, discover new dishes, and build a community around the joy of cooking.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Our Story</h3>
                    <p>As students passionate about cooking and technology, we decided to combine our skills and create a project that would allow people to share their culinary creations. What started as a simple idea for a recipe catalog grew into an exciting web application that allows users to browse, share, and even rate recipes.</p>
